## **Draggable Cards**

This project was changed to manage multiple draggable cards by using a shared class.

## **Features**

1. Smooth Dragging: Cards move smoothly, following your mouse position.
2. Multiple Cards: Easily include multiple cards without needing specific IDs.
3. Z-index Control: The most recently selected card always stays on top based on selection history.

This code is a fork from a CodePen example, modified to handle multiple cards without using individual IDs. 
Instead, it works with a class for all cards. Edit: Included "The most recently selected card always stays on top based on selection history."
